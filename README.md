## Homework.

Practice what you have learned about using classes, abstract, classes and interfaces to model and test a simple system which interests or seems relevant to you.


## To Do.

Pick a system/scenario (examples below) which you can visualise easily, then attempt to model that system in Java.
This can be anything you want, but if you are struggling for ideas, here are some suggestions;

## Examples.


## Kaiju Attack.

Model a Kaiju (Large Japanese Monster) Attack On A City.

1. Using a 'Kaiju' abstract class, create two giant lizards to run amok in Tokyo.
  Parameters for each Kaiju should include; 'name', 'healthValue' and 'attackValue'.
  Give the Kaiju a 'roar' method which returns a string.
2. Using a 'Vehicle' abstract class, create two Army vehicles to battle the Kaiju.
  Parameters should include; 'type' and 'healthValue'.
3. Give the Kaiju an 'attack' method which can be used to damage vehicles.
4. Give the Kaiju a 'move'/'fly' method, which returns a string (depending on the Kaiju).
5.  Give the army vehicles two methods of damaging the Kaiju. (Give  the vehicles attack methods).
6. Expand the model to include buildings, more Kaiju and anything else you can think of.
